Password Strength Evaluation
üìå Objective
Understand what makes a password strong, test passwords using online strength checkers, and summarize findings on best practices for password security.
üîß Tools
Online password strength checkers:
Password Meter
How Secure Is My Password.
üìù Steps Performed
1. Create Multiple Passwords
Designed sample passwords with varying complexity:
Weak: mypassword
Medium: MyPassword123
Strong: Myp@ssw0rd!2025
Very Strong: T!r9#xZpQwL7@8gFhM
2. Test on Password Strength Tools
Entered each password into the checker.
Recorded score and feedback.
| Password             | Score/Rating       | Feedback from Tool                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `mypassword`         | Very Weak (10%)    | Too short, common dictionary word    |
| `MyPassword123`      | Medium (50%)       | Predictable pattern, still guessable |
| `Myp@ssw0rd!2025`    | Strong (85%)       | Good mix of characters, longer       |
| `T!r9#xZpQwL7@8gFhM` | Very Strong (100%) | Random, long, highly secure          |
4. Identify Best Practices
From the tests, strong passwords generally:
Use 12+ characters.
Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
Avoid dictionary words and simple patterns.
Do not reuse across accounts.
Are stored in a password manager when possible.
5. Research on Common Attacks
Brute Force Attack: tries all possible combinations.
Dictionary Attack: uses common words or known password.
Credential Stuffing: uses leaked username/password pairs.
6. Summary of Findings
Password length significantly increases strength.
Complexity (mix of characters) reduces predictability.
Randomness protects against dictionary and brute force attacks.
Strong passwords make it impractical for attackers to crack within a reasonable time.
